I am Haobo LI (李昊波), a year-1 Ph.D. student at [HKUST VisLab](http://vis.cse.ust.hk/), at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by Prof. [Huamin Qu](http://www.huamin.org/). Before joining HKUST, I obtained my M.S. degree and B.S. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and South China University of Technology, respectively. Then I worked at Intel for about 2 years.
